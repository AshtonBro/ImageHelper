## Building Windows 8 Apps with C# and XAML 👨‍🎓 📚

### In this repository, you can see the different capabilities and features of the XAML language, as well as learn how to write applications for Windows using C # and XAML.
______
__ImageHelper__ - The application, you can take a picture using a webcam connected to your computer, but also save it. You can also get a picture from another user and watch it. <br>
______
__DependencyProperties__ - This system expands the capabilities of traditional properties, dependent properties participate in inheritance relations, can influence other classes and are managed in a special way. <br>
______
__StoryboardExamp__ - The app illustrates different uses of the timeline, animation and some styles. <br>
______
__Layout__ - A Windows application should have a flexible and reactive layout that works well on any screen form factor. In part, this concerns portrait and landscape screen orientations, various sizes, as well as the lock mode. XAML provides many UI-elements designed to make it easier to build layouts for your application. <br>
______
__Panels__ - The app shows many examples of layouts for managing object lists. Such as: GridView, ListView, FlipView, ListBox. <br>
______
__Touch__ - Windows makes it easy to work with events from different devices by providing a set of hardware-independent pointing events. Pointing events occur when a touchscreen, stylus, mouse, or keyboard is used to interact with an application. How it works can be seen in the Touch application.
______
__EncryptionSigning__ - The CryptograthicEngine class supports data encryption and digital signature generation. This class provides the means for encrypting, decrypting, creating even signatures, and verifying them. In the EncryptionSigning project, there are some simple examples of these operations.
